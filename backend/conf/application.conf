## Evolutions
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# Evolutions allows database scripts to be automatically run on startup in dev mode
# for database migrations. You must enable this by adding to build.sbt:
#
# libraryDependencies += evolutions
#
play.evolutions {
  # You can disable evolutions for a specific datasource if necessary
  #db.default.enabled = false
  autoApply = true
}


## JDBC Datasource
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaDatabase
# https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaDatabase
# ~~~~~
# Once JDBC datasource is set up, you can work with several different
# database options:
#
# Slick (Scala preferred option): https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/PlaySlick
# JPA (Java preferred option): https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaJPA
# EBean: https://playframework.com/documentation/latest/JavaEbean
# Anorm: https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ScalaAnorm
#
slick.dbs.default {
  # You can declare as many datasources as you want.
  # By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

  profile = "slick.jdbc.H2Profile$"

  db {
    # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Developing-with-the-H2-Database
    driver = "org.h2.Driver"
    url = "jdbc:h2:mem:play;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DATABASE_TO_UPPER=FALSE"
    # default.username = sa
    # default.password = ""
    connectionPool = disabled
    keepAliveConnection = true
  }

  # You can turn on SQL logging for any datasource
  # https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/Highlights25#Logging-SQL-statements
  #default.logSql=true
}

# API prefix to be used for all API routes
apiPrefix = "api"
